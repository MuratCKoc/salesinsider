# Sales Insider Proposal

# Goal

Shopping can be defined as a customer making a selection of good/services from a list of vendors/providers.

Our goal is to design an algorithm that can help understand a customer's purchasing habits and identifying trends that can be investigated for vendors to create better deals and sales offerings. 

Specifically we are interested in looking at answering three questions:
 1. When do the consumers purchase?
 2. What do they purchase?
 3. What can they possibly purchase together, (I.E. what can be bundled together)?
 4. When is peak traffic during the day and what consumables are purchased√â
